  <p id="about-text">
    Radishes, carrots and lettuce are a good example of complimentary vegetables. The really work well together and will flourish better as a team rather than as individual plantings.
</br>
</br>
    Radishes, carrots and lettuce both often come in seed tapes and I recommend their use. Although I have had good luck with individual seeds with radishes and lettuce the seed tape is simpler. Carrots appear to be impossible to plant properly as individual seeds thus I highly recommend seed tapes.
</br>
</br>
Radishes grow well in the very early spring and are industructable. Early spring radishes are not hot however and too much water makes them unpalatable. Lettuce comes in hot and cool varieties. Head lettuce likes it cool and is planted in spring. Bib lettuce, Butter Crunch and others enjoy the warm temperatures and are fit for late Spring and Summer. Carrots could care less either way
