    There's so much information on tomatoes out there that I thought I would add some information most folks don't know. At least those that are beginners don't know.
    </br>

    Tomatoes are fairly rugged. You can move them around the garden especially when relatively small. Once they are large moving them can shock them to death. They love lots of water, potassium and nitrogen. If however you give them too much nitrogen they just produce lots of leaves and less tomatoes. 
    </br>

    Commercial tomatoes are bred to be rugged for transport. They are also picked early such that they are pre-ripe and easy to transport without crushing. For both reasons they are tasteless. One of the best varieties is the Belgium or German Tomato. Sometimes known as the Italian Tomato tree. They produce two pound tomatoes which don't look great but are awesome. They have a very thin skin and can't be transported. But they taste great on everything and make great sauce. The most versatile tomato in existence.

In Italian the word for tomato is Pomodoro which means Golden Apple. The first tomatoes that arrived in Italy from the New World were yellow and thus the name. Yellow varieties are still great. Lemon boy is one of my favorite golden varieties.
