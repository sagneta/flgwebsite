    Corn is second only to wheat as the most important grain on planet Earth. They are worth growing and don't require as much space as you think. Very quickly I will go through the three-sister hilling method used by the native Americans. This is the one I prefer.
    </br>
    </br>
    Great large mounds or hills. Insert four corn kernels on each side of the mound: north, south, east and west. Plant butternut squash in the around the bottom of the mounds. The corn go towards the top. Once the corn stalks are a foot high plant sugar snap peas around each stalk and they will wind their way up. That is the three sisters. Also the mounds should be sufficient to pollinate but you can do that by hand should you wish to.
    </br>
    </br>
    Corn are heavy feeders so use fertilizer, compost and rotate the crops for each season.
