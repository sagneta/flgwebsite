    The squash varieties are so varied and such abundant producers that they need little information from me. I will however provide the following little tips.
    </br>
    </br>
    Zucchini need to be picked when reasonably small for best taste. All squash like lots of water. Beware of the little yellow beetles with black stripes. They are bad. Insecticidal soap should do the trick.
    </br>
    </br>
    Butternut squash love corn. Grown them around the stalks. They will thrive and will protect the corn from predators (apparently raccoons find the prickly plants painful) and will cover up and control the weeds. In fact growing corn with winter squash around the stalks and pole beans growing up the corn stalks is called 'the three sisters' is is the native American method of gardening.
    </br>

    Larger pumpkin varieties do better than those that produce small pumpkins at least in my plot. Just thought I would mention it. Casper varieties do well also.
