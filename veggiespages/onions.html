  <p id="about-text">
    Onions are a no brainer. I prefer to plant from sets which are tiny little onions as opposed to seeds as it is easier and gives the onion a head-start on the season. Given that I live in the North with long Summer days the gardener should rely upon long-day onion varieties.
</br>
</br>
 Onions prefer acidic soil and compliment strawberries, garlic, red cabbage and potatoes. Yellow onions appear to perform best in my soil for some odd reason but white and red should do fine also. 
</br>
</br>
Growing from seed is much cheaper and you can grow good varieties which do not come in sets. However it takes much longer. More like half a year. This fall I am going to try it out by planting seeds in September. They should survive the winter like garlic and be ready by August. Ya, it takes that long. Another advantage is they grow much larger if that is what you are into.
