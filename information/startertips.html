 Vegetable gardening is simpler than you think but there is an infinite amount to learn as well. Below is a simple bullet-ted list for those starting a garden to concentrate on. 

<br/>
<br/>

The key is to start at a manageable size along with a small variety of vegetables. Start with one bed 5 feet wide and 5-10 feet long.

<br/>
<br/>
80 Percent of vegetable gardening is soil preparation. Don't ignore this as plants actually live in the soil.

<br/>
<br/>
Start a compost pile. What you use depends upon your land usage. I have a page devoted to my compost pile which you can examine. 

<br/>
<br/>
Use a raised bed but it is not necessary to use boards. In fact I don't recommend boards as I use a 5 bed system in which I sometimes expand or contract the beds as I rotate crops. With a fixed bed system you can't do this. Raised beds sans boards are referred to as mounds sometimes. I have a page devoted also to the 5 mound bed system.

<br/>
<br/>
Loosen the soil down to two feet. I'm not kidding. Purchase or rant a tiller if necessary but do it. It makes a huge difference. Do it two weeks before the first planting.

<br/>
<br/>
Start with vegetables that probably will grow no matter the conditions. Radishes and Garlic are no brainers. Tomato plants are the weeds of the vegetable garden. Head and Bib lettuce along with pol beans and sugar snaps. Onions of any variety from sets. That should be enough to start. Notice that I didn't mention zucchini? If you start small you don't have the room. If you want a squash patch (zucchini, butternut, pumpkins, etal) then you require a second bed.

<br/>
<br/>
Purchase rain barrels and insert beneath the drain pipes. Not only will you save water, money and frustration with local water bans but rain water doesn't contain chlorine which is hard on vegetables. 

<br/>
<br/>
If you live near the ocean pick up sea weed in the fall after some storms. This is great fertilizer. Just spread it on-top of the garden over the winter. It will seep into the soil all the goodness but will not emit an order in the spring. two to three weeks before first planting in the spring rototil the seaweed into the soil along with any mulch from the compost pile that is ready.

<br/>
<br/>
If you have a lot of leaves in the fall (oak leaves are noted for making outstanding compost) then consider purchasing a composter to increase the speed of composting and decrease the size of the compost file. It will also mulch wood which is nice.

<br/>
<br/>
If you use wood chips within the garden (that includes wood mulch) then you need to add lots of nitrogen as the bacteria (the true rulers of the Earth) that break down cellulose require lots of nitrogen and thus deplete the garden soil. Wood and burnt wood is however a greet soil amendment with Potassium and other elements that Tomatoes love in particular.

<br/>
<br/>
Note that potatoes, onions and garlic prefer acidic soil. Nobody tells you this but its really true. 

<br/>
<br/>
Clover is good for the soil. It is a nitrogen fixer and will also suppress weeds so keep it in the garden. In fact you can grow it around beans.

<br/>
<br/>
Beans and peas should be planted with soil inoculate. That is a nitrogen fixing bacteria. This is the secrete behind beans and peas in that they don't need to get nitrogen from the soil but can get it from bacteria which in turn retrieve it from the atmosphere which is 70% nitrogen. Thus beans and peas can produce in poor l soils. 

<br/>
<br/>
If you need to purchase soil as I did to get started by all means do so. Just make sure the soil is appropriate for gardening. That is ensure that it does not contain heavy metals.

<br/>
<br/>
If you are using your own grass clippings for compost go easy on the herbicides within various brands of garden fertilizer. In fact do without it. Just purchase 10-10-10 in bulk and live free of chemicals. Keep in mind that herbicides stop vegetables from growing and don't break down that fast so ease up. I also don't use herbicides directly on the garden. 

<br/>
<br/>
For insects use organic insecticides like insecticidal soap which works great. If you must use something like Seven, use intermittently. Organic fungicides also work great.

<br/>
<br/>
Plants veggies that are complimentary and not antagonistic. See this page for more details.

<br/>
<br/>
Coffee grounds from Starbucks or you own coffee pot (use non bleached filters) are great compost. They are also acidic and in fact potatoes love it. Just dump it on top of them. And yes the potato patch will smell like coffee.

<br/>
<br/>
That's already plenty isn't it! Once you get beyond all this you will be well started and are ready for the 5 bed system and some more advanced gardening tips.
